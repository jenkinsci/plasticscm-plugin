# Release notes

## Version X.X (pending)
* The plugin now requires Java 11, and Jenkins 2.176.4 or higher.

## Version 4.4 (07 Aug 2023)

* Fixed checkout errors when using subdirectories

## Version 4.3 (02 Aug 2023)

* Added shelves support. Now we allow users to enter 'shelveset' selectors for their Plastic SCM configurations in Jenkins, either for freestyle projects or pipelines from SCM.

* Added DevOps workflows capabilities from Plastic SCM to be triggered in Jenkins. Mergebots trigger builds, setting the spec to build in a specific parameter. The Mergebot SCM picks that up and uses it to checkout the sources.

* Added support for Single repository & branch mapping in Multibranch pipelines

* Fixed an issue that caused an error during the pooling process on a pipeline.

## Version 4.2 (06 Jul 2022)

* Fixed an issue that caused workspace commands to fail when the Jenkins controller runs on Windows
and the agent on Linux/Mac (or vice versa). With this fix, we leverage the virtual channel provided by Jenkins
(representing the node building the job) to ensure the workspace paths keep the format of the builder node's OS.

## Version 4.1 (29 Jun 2022)

* Ensured environment variables are replaced in the selector contents.

## Version 4.0 (10 Dec 2021)

* Project configurations can specify a Plastic SCM working mode and credentials. The installed `cm`
  will use those values to run all commands for that project. Credentials are specified and
  retrieved using the Jenkins Credentials API.
* The `cm` tool configuration is now exposed as a Jenkins Tool. By default, all Jenkins setups
  will define at least one `cm` configuration, called `Default`. The default configuration includes
  the Plastic SCM installer, which will automatically download and install the latest version of the
  `cm` client from the Plastic SCM website.

## Version 3.6  (24 May 2021)

* Upgraded XML parser dependencies

## Version 3.5 (10 Nov 2020)

### Improvements

* Pipeline jobs can now pull from a changeset number.
* It's now possible to define a cleanup method for each workspace when doing an update.

### Fixes

* Fixed how the plugin manages workspaces multiple levels deep.

## Version 3.4 (07 Oct 2020)

### Fixes

* Fixed an issue that caused changeset-based selector builds to only retrieve the correct contents
  the first time. This happened if you upgraded the Plastic SCM CLI client in your Jenkins machine
  to version 8.0.16.3470 or higher. That version changes the behavior of `cm update` so it always
  retrieves the latest contents in the branch, even if you specified a changeset in the selector.
* The `cm find` and `cm log` commands failed if their output was too long. We changed how those
  commands handle their XML output. They'll write it directly to a file instead of using `stdout`.
  This avoids the stream issues that some users reported.

## Version 3.3 (13 Nov 2019)

### Improvements

* We migrated the Plastic SCM plugin documentation to GitHub!

### Fixes

* The `log` command now explicitly specifies the XML output encoding.

## Version 3.2 (29 Aug 2019)

### Fixes

* The REST API returned serialization errors. We adapted the Plastic SCM Build Data class and its
  dependencies to fix them.
* Changes in version 3.0 had broken compatibility with cloud repositories. It's fixed now.
* If you deleted the last built changeset of a job in the Plastic SCM repository, then all builds
  of new checked in changesets would fail because they wouln't be able to calculate the change log.
  Now the plugin will keep going back the build history until it detects a built changeset that
  still exists.

## Version 3.1 (26 Aug 2019)

### Fixes

* SCM Polling was broken in the previous release: deserialization was inconsistent for the command
  that calculates the new changesets between last build and current polling iteration.

## Version 3.0 (19 Aug 2019)

Version 3 is out! This new major version enhances build information and improves SCM configuration
parameters. Big shout-out to Housemarque, who contributed enormously to this new batch of changes.
Enjoy!

⚠ **Important** ⚠ Jenkins baseline version is now 2.60.3 and Plastic SCM client minimum version
is 8.0.16.3400! Please ensure you have your software up to date before upgrading the Plastic SCM
plugin.

### Improvements

* Configuration changed: the Workspace Name parameter was replaced by a new Subdirectory parameter.
  This allows you full control over where Plastic SCM will download the contens without having to
  worry about workspace name duplicity. Workspace names are now randomly generated every time the
  CLI client needs to create a workspace.
  * The Subdirectory parameter has smart validation: it can be empty if there's only a single
    workspace but required if additional workspaces are selected.
* All builds will have a "last changeset info" now, even if an old build is re-run or there aren't
  any new changes in the Plastic SCM server.
* Show Plastic SCM changeset information in the *Job status* view.
* Added the *Plastic SCM Build Data* view
* Configuration forms are protected against CSRF attacks. This ensures that only users with
  configuration permissions can check/validate repository access.
* Massive code refactoring to match common Java coding standars
* Included Checkstyle to verify code style and quality
* Added translation support to UI snippets
* Added a README file in the GitHub repository with software requirements and instructions about
  how to develop the plugin

### Fixes

* All issues related to workspace name collision are gone now. As detailed in improvements, you'll
  no longer need to configure workspace names or worry about duplicates. You can specify the actual
  subdirectory to check out the sources and the workspace name is randomly generated.
* All parameters have a default value when an additional workspace is added.
* Changelog calculations:
  * Branch is now taken into account to show incremental changes
  * Fixed issues when the Plastic SCM server and the Jenkins server are in different time zones
  * Fixed issues when the build was performed in separate Agents

## Version 2.23 (08 Jul 2019)

* Since version 2.22, the plugin is using paths instead of names to find out whether a workspace
  exists. However, that caused an issue with Windows agents that had their root paths specified
  with forward slashes (such as `C:/jenkins/myAgent`). This is fixed now.

## Version 2.22 (26 Jun 2019)

* Changes in previous version broke how workspace names were set, which was fixed in this release.
* The 'use multiple workspaces' checkbox was broken as well in freestyle and declarative pipeline
  projects because it was always set as true. Fixed.
* We improved how shared library projects are detected to avoid inconsistent workspace names like
  `shl-[number]`.
* We added support for build parameters in Jenkinsfile pipelines that have lightweight checkout
  enabled.
* The cm path field in the plugin global configuration section now has a validation button.

## Version 2.21 (12 Jun 2019)

There were issues with shared libraries when two or more projects were consuming a single shared
library. They were related to the workspace names assigned to the shared library workspace for each
project, which turned out to be always the same. We fixed that to make every shared library
workspace have its own self-generated workspace name.

## Version 2.20 (10 Aug 2018)

We improved how the plugin reports errors in a Pipeline with Lightweight checkout. Before this,
if the Jenkinsfile download failed only a 'NULL' message was printed. Now the complete command
execution is displayed.

Fixed an incompatibility with other plugins if they require the SCM plugin to support the
`ChangeLogSet.Entry.getAffectedfiles()` method.

## Version 2.19 (07 Aug 2018)

Added support to SCM environment variables for pipelines.

Now, you can check the available ones here: <https://{your-jenkins}/env-vars.html>

## Version 2.18 (19 Jul 2018)

* The `${workspace-path} is not in a workspace` error was thrown the next time that Jenkins started
  a build if the workspace had been previously removed. Fixed.
* The find changeset operation used a wrong branch when the specified branch value was different
  from the default one in parameterized builds. Fixed.

## Version 2.17 (03 Jul 2018)

* The checkout process will undo all local changes in the workspace if there are any, to make sure
  the update operation won't fail.
* The environment variables weren't properly set if the current or previous build checkout failed.
  Fixed.
* The Plastic SCM plugin didn't work with pipeline projects. This is a regression of 2.16 version.
  Fixed.

## Version 2.16 (08 Jun 2018)

The Plastic SCM plugin had a file path issue that prevented it from working as expected when the
 master and slave instances had different OS. Fixed.

## Version 2.15 (16 May 2018)

The parameters of the plastic workspace name were not correctly resolved. It means, it used the
exact workspace name string (e.g. `Jenkins-${JOB_NAME}-${NODE_NAME}`) without resolving the
parameters JOB_NAME and NODE_NAME (e.g. `Jenkins-project-MASTER`). Fixed.

## Version 2.14 (03 May 2018)

The Plastic SCM plugin can work with multiple plastic workspaces or just a single plastic workspace.
Now, the jenkins workspace and the plastic workspace paths will match in the single workspace mode.

Therefore, some jenkins features (such as pipeline shared libraries) that need both paths to match
 will correctly work.

## Version 2.13 (20 Apr 2018)

* Added support for the lightweight checkout feature in the pipeline jobs. It requires that the
latest version of `cm` is installed.
* The environment variables were not published when there were no new changes in the build. Fixed.

## Version 2.12 (10 Apr 2018)

Blue Ocean only rendered the first changeset in the details if more than one were built. Also,
the commit and timestamp info was missing. Fixed.

## Version 2.11 (23 Mar 2018)

Reduced the number of duplicated builds that can happen using the Plastic SCM plugin. Now, the scm
polling takes into account the current build, avoiding to start a new build for the same changeset.

## Version 2.10 (11 Jan 2018)

We fixed an issue configuring existing pipeline projects: the PlasticSCM entry didn't appear in the
SCM dropdown list if the pipeline was set to get the script from SCM.

Also, now the Plastic SCM configuration will automatically propose a default workspace name for the
first (mandatory) workspace.

## Version 2.9 (17 Mar 2017)

From now on, each build will publish environment variables containing the data of the built
changeset for each configured workspace. These are the variables exposed by the main workspace
of the project:

* `PLASTICSCM_CHANGESET_ID`: Number of the currently built changeset
* `PLASTICSCM_CHANGESET_GUID`: GUID of the currently built changeset
* `PLASTICSCM_BRANCH`: Name of the branch in Plastic SCM
* `PLASTICSCM_AUTHOR`: Name of the user who created the currently build changeset
* `PLASTICSCM_REPSPEC`: The configured repository specification for the current build

Additional workspaces will include their position in the list, like this:

* `PLASTICSCM_1_CHANGESET_GUID`
* `PLASTICSCM_5_AUTHOR`
* `PLASTICSCM_9_CHANGESET_ID`
* etc.

## Version 2.8 (16 Feb 2017)

* The required core version is now 1.580.1
* Added support for pipelines
* Fixed builds being triggered if connection with the Plastic SCM server was lost.
* Plastic SCM commands will be retried 3 times from now on, waiting 0.5 seconds between retries.

The pipeline script syntax for Plastic SCM is:

```groovy
cm(
    branch: '<full-branch-name>',
    changelog: (true|false),
    poll: (true|false),
    repository: '<rep-name>',
    server: '<server-address>:<server-port>',
    useUpdate: (true|false),
    workspaceName: '<wk-name-using-jenkins-variables>'
)
```

For example:

```groovy
cm(
    branch: '/main',
    changelog: true,
    poll: true,
    repository: 'default',
    server: 'localhost:8087',
    useUpdate: true,
    workspaceName: 'Jenkins-${JOB_NAME}-${NODE_NAME}'
)
```

## Version 2.7 (10 Oct 2016)

* Fixed a problem causing parameterized builds to have their workspaces deleted before each
  build run.

## Version 2.6 (26 Jul 2016)

* Replaced all relative paths (implicit or explicit) with full, explicit paths. This fixed several
  issues on Mac OS X since apparently the current working directory for VCS commands is being set to
  `/` by Jenkins.

## Version 2.5 (25 Apr 2016)

* Cross-platform setups (linux server + windows agents) were deleting workspaces before each build,
  regardless of the actual "Use update" checkbox value. Fixed.

## Version 2.4 (29 Feb 2016)

* Workspaces were being deleted before each build on Windows, regardless of the actual value of the
 "Use update" checkbox. Fixed.

## Version 2.3 (21 Oct 2015)

* Added build parameters support in the Plastic SCM selector. Jenkins allows to define build
  parameters (<https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Parameterized+Build>), and Plastic SCM
  now can use those parameters in its selector.
* **IMPORTANT NOTE**: When using parametrized builds, maybe the Poll SCM feature may not work as
  expected because Jenkins performs the poll with the LAST USED workspace. So maybe the selector is
  not placed in the branch you expect the poll is performed.
* When using parametrized builds we recommend setting up two Jenkins projects:
  * One for the parametrized build
  * Other, with an static selector to perform the poll.

* Fixed: When a changeset was a result of a merge, Jenkins was not able to properly present modified
  elements in 'Changes' chapter.

## Version 2.2 (09 Dec 2014)

* The Jenkins workspaces now support multiple Plastic SCM workspaces.

## Version 2.1 (02 Sep 2014)

* Fixed an issue related to the non-ASCII characters included on the date on some cultures such as
  Korean culture.
* Support labels and changesets in the Plastic SCM selector.
* The plugin did not reuse Plastic SCM workspaces correctly when the 'Use update' preference was
  set. Fixed.

## Version 2.0 (20 Jan 2012)

* Plugin adapted to Plastic SCM version 4.

## Version 1.0 (29 Mar 2011)

* Initial version.
