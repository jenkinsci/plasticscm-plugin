## Configuration

### System configuration

In order to configure the plugin, you need the `cm` executable installed in the Jenkins server
machine. Then, please follow these steps:

1. Open the system configuration page "Manage Jenkins" and navigate to "Configure System"
2. Scroll down to the "Plastic SCM" section and enter the path where the `cm` executable (CLI
   client) is located
3. Click "Check" to verify that the path you set is correct
4. You can leave the field empty: "`cm`" will be used by default (i.e. the executable will be
   loaded from `$PATH`)

## Job configuration

### Freestyle projects

Scroll down to the Source Code Management section and select "Plastic SCM" (see screenshot below).
You'll need to enter a valid **selector**, which will be used to check out the repository contents
in every build. The "Poll SCM" trigger also uses that selector.

Every build will ensure that the Jenkins workspace contains a Plastic SCM before starting the
`cm update` operation. If you'd like to create the Plastic SCM workspace in a particular
subdirectory under the Jenkins job workspace, you can specify one in the **Subdirectory** field.
This field is mandatory if you want to use multiple workspaces.

If you want to keep the workspace between builds, check the **Use update box**. Otherwise, the
Plastic SCM workspace and its contents will be deleted before each build.

### Selector format

The selector accepts branches, changesets or labels. You can setup not only branches (which is the
normal case), but labels as well as changesets in the selector.

**Branch selector:**

```text
repository "myRepo@my.plasticscm.server.com:8087"
  path "/"
    smartbranch "/main/scm1773"
```

**Changeset selector:**

```text
repository "myRepo@my.plasticscm.server.com:8087"
  path "/"
    smartbranch "/main/scm1773" changeset "7030383"
```

**Label selector:**

```text
repository "myRepo@my.plasticscm.server.com:8087"
  path "/"
    label "1.0.32-preview_997"
```

**Important!** Don't forget to use the `ssl://` prefix in the server name if your Plastic
Server utilizes SSL. For instance, `repository "myRepo@ssl://my.plasticscm.server.com:8088"`

You can also use build parameters in the selector.
Example: Let's say that you defined two build parameters in your project:

* `branchname` - default value (/main)
* `repositoryname` - default value (default)

Then you can use those parameters in the Plastic SCM selector using the macro pattern
`$parameter_name`:

```text
repository '$repositoryname'
    path "/"
        smartbranch '$branchname'
```

### Multiple workspaces

The Plastic SCM plugin allows you to checkout multiple workspaces in a single Jenkins workspace.
This can be useful if you need to fetch sources from two or more repositories in order to build your
application.

To enable this feature, check the **Use multiple workspaces** box in the SCM configuration. You'll
see a new button "Add workspace..." to append a new workspace to the list of additional workspaces.
The configuration settings are identical to the root ones.

![Freestyle, multiple workspaces](doc/img/freestyle-configuration-multiple-workspaces.png)

⚠ Be careful! ⚠ This setup requires you to specify a subdirectory value **for all
workspaces**, and they must be different from one another. If you don't, you might risk having the
plugin download the contents from two or more repositories into the same directory.

### Pipelines

If you use scripted pipelines or you want to specify the pipeline script directly in the job
configuration, you can take advantage of the cm command inside the groovy script:

**cm command syntax:**

```groovy
cm(
    branch: '<full-branch-name>',
    repository: '<rep-name>',
    server: '<server-address>:<server-port>',
    useUpdate: (true|false),
    directory: '<subdirectory-name>'
)
```

As you see, there's a one-to-one parameter mapping. To use multiple workspaces you simply need to
add multiple `cm` statements, paying attention to the value of the `directory` parameter.

**cm command example:**

```groovy
cm(
    branch: '/hotfix',
    repository: 'assets-repo',
    server: 'my.plasticscm.server.com:8087',
    useUpdate: true,
    directory: 'assets'
)
```

**Important!** Don't forget to use the `ssl://` prefix in the server name if your Plastic
Server utilizes SSL. For instance, `server: 'ssl://my.plasticscm.server.com:8088',`

If you'd rather use declarative pipelines (selecting the **Pipeline script from SCM** option),
you'll have to specify the Plastic SCM configuration just as you'd do for a freestyle project. Then,
two new parameters will appear: **Script path** and **Lightweight checkout**.

![Pipeline script from SCM](doc/img/pipeline-script-from-scm.png)

The script path tells Jenkins where to find the pipeline script file. **This path is relative to the
Jenkins workspace!** So, if you defined subdirectories (regardless of how many additional
repositories you described) you'll need to include the subdirectory in the Script path. See an
example below:

![Pipeline script, multiple workspaces](doc/img/pipeline-script-multiple-workspaces.png)

Enabling **lightweight checkout** lets Jenkins retrieve the pipeline script file directly, without a
full Plastic SCM update.

## Build information

### Summary

The build summary includes a reference to the Plastic SCM changeset spec that was built.

![Build summary](doc/img/build-summary.png)

### Changes list

The changes page in each build will have details about each of the changesets that were included in
the build, linked from the summary list.

![Changes summary](doc/img/changes-summary.png)

### Plastic SCM Build Data

You'll find a link in the build page sidebar to display the Plastic SCM data for that build.

![Build data](doc/img/Plastic-SCM-Build-Data.png)

### Environment variables

If the checkout operation succeeds, these environment variables will be populated with the
appropriate values for the build:

1. `PLASTICSCM_CHANGESET_ID`: Number of the currently built changeset
2. `PLASTICSCM_CHANGESET_GUID`: GUID of the currently built changeset
3. `PLASTICSCM_BRANCH`: Name of the branch in Plastic SCM
4. `PLASTICSCM_AUTHOR`: Name of the user who created the currently build changeset
5. `PLASTICSCM_REPSPEC`: The configured repository specification for the current build

Additional workspaces will include their position in the list, like this:

1. `PLASTICSCM_1_CHANGESET_GUID`
2. `PLASTICSCM_5_AUTHOR`
3. `PLASTICSCM_9_CHANGESET_ID`
4. etc.

#### Pipelines

Please have in mind that running the `cm` command in a pipeline script won't automatically set the
environment variables above! This command, as do all VCS commands, returns a dictionary that
contains the environment values set as expected.

To take advantage of that, you should do something like this:

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any

  environment {
    PLASTICSCM_WORKSPACE_NAME = "${env.JOB_BASE_NAME}_${env.BUILD_NUMBER}"
    PLASTICSCM_TARGET_SERVER = "192.168.1.73:8087"
    PLASTICSCM_TARGET_REPOSITORY = "default"
  }

  stages {
    stage('SCM Checkout') {
      steps {
        script {
          def plasticVars = cm(
            branch: "main",
            changelog: true,
            repository: env.PLASTICSCM_TARGET_REPOSITORY,
            server: env.PLASTICSCM_TARGET_SERVER,
            useUpdate: false
          )

          plasticVars.each {
            key, value -> println("${key} = ${value}")
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In the code above, the `plasticVars` dictionary would only be available in the `script` block
inside the 'SCM Checkout' stage. If you'd like access it across different scripts, steps or stages,
you can define the variable in the global scope:

```groovy
def plasticVars

pipeline {
  agent any

  environment {
    PLASTICSCM_WORKSPACE_NAME = "${env.JOB_BASE_NAME}_${env.BUILD_NUMBER}"
    PLASTICSCM_TARGET_SERVER = "192.168.1.73:8087"
    PLASTICSCM_TARGET_REPOSITORY = "default"
  }

  stages {
    stage('SCM Checkout') {
      steps {
        script {
          plasticVars = cm(
            branch: "main",
            changelog: true,
            repository: env.PLASTICSCM_TARGET_REPOSITORY,
            server: env.PLASTICSCM_TARGET_SERVER,
            useUpdate: false
          )
        }

        script {
          plasticVars.each {
            key, value -> println("${key} = ${value}")
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Requirements

* Jenkins `2.60.3` or newer
* Plastic SCM command line client `8.0.16.3400` or newer

## Upgrading from 2.x to 3.x

The upgrade process is mostly seamless. You'll only need to review the configuration parameters of
your jobs **if you configured them to use multiple workspaces**. Since the subdirectory name was
inferred from the workspace name before and that parameter is now gone, the **Subdirectory**
parameter (used now to specify the subdirectory name explicitly) will be empty. Builds might
download all workspaces in the same directory!
