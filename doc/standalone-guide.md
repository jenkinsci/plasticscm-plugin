The standalone way to work with Plastic SCM in Jenkins enables you to work against a Plastic SCM Server and optionally
poll the repo for changes.

## Project configuration

The Jenkins controller and its agents need to have a Plastic SCM client present in their machines or containers.
You can achieve that by defining Plastic SCM as a Jenkins Global Tool. Check our
[External Tool Configuration guide](external-tool-configuration.md) for more information.

### Freestyle projects

Scroll down to the Source Code Management section and select "Plastic SCM" (see screenshot below).
You'll need to enter a valid **selector**, which will be used to check out the repository contents
in every build. The "Poll SCM" trigger also uses that selector.

Every build will ensure that the Jenkins workspace contains a Plastic SCM before starting the
`cm update` operation. If you'd like to create the Plastic SCM workspace in a particular
subdirectory under the Jenkins job workspace, you can specify one in the **Directory** field.
This field is mandatory if you want to use multiple workspaces.

The _Cleanup_ value will determine what to do with the Plastic SCM workspace before checking out
the code. It has four possible values:

* **Minimal cleanup** will simply undo any changed files in the workspace directory and then run
  a workspace update. It's equivalent to enabling _Use update_ in older versions.
* **Standard cleanup** will undo changed files and also remove any private files that might be
  present in the workspace directory. Ignored files aren't affected. This is the recommended
  setting.
* **Full cleanup** has the same behavior as _Standard cleanup_ but removes ignored files as well.
* **Delete workspace** will remove the entire workspace contents and create a new one. Useful if you
  absolutely want to start every build from scratch. It might increase the build time if your
  workspace is big, though. It's equivalent to disabling _Use update_ in older versions.

You can also define specific credentials to be used by Plastic SCM in the context of the job. You can select the
target working mode, which can be one of these:

* **Use system configuration**
    * Don't specify credentials for this job, rely on an existing `client.conf` file in the machine.
* **User & password**
    * If your targeted Plastic SCM Server uses Plastic SCM user/password authentication, this is the option to choose.
* **LDAP / Cloud**
    * The appropriate choice if your targeted Plastic SCM Server is a Plastic Cloud organization or it uses LDAP as
      authentication provider.

Then, for _User & password_ and _LDAP / Cloud_ you need to specify credentials using the Jenkins Credentials API.

Finally, the _Poll on controller_ option allows you to run the polling operation on the Jenkins controller instead of
the agent. This is useful if you're using Kubernetes agents, for example, and you want to make sure that the polling
operation is always executed, even if the agent is not available. See the [Poll on controller](#poll-on-controller)
section below for more information.

### Selector format

The selector accepts branches, changesets or labels. You can setup not only branches (which is the
normal case), but labels as well as changesets in the selector.

**Branch selector:**

```text
repository "myRepo@my.plasticscm.server.com:8087"
  path "/"
    smartbranch "/main/scm1773"
```

**Changeset selector:**

```text
repository "myRepo@my.plasticscm.server.com:8087"
  path "/"
    smartbranch "/main/scm1773" changeset "7030383"
```

**Label selector:**

```text
repository "myRepo@my.plasticscm.server.com:8087"
  path "/"
    label "1.0.32-preview_997"
```

**Shelveset selector:**

```text
repository "myRepo@my.plasticscm.server.com:8087"
  path "/"
    shelve "51"
```

**Important!** Don't forget to use the `ssl://` prefix in the server name if your Plastic
Server utilizes SSL. For instance, `repository "myRepo@ssl://my.plasticscm.server.com:8088"`

You can also use build parameters in the selector.
Example: Let's say that you defined two build parameters in your project:

* `branchname` - default value (/main)
* `repositoryname` - default value (default)

Then you can use those parameters in the Plastic SCM selector using the macro pattern
`$parameter_name`:

```text
repository '$repositoryname'
    path "/"
        smartbranch '$branchname'
```

### Multiple workspaces

The Plastic SCM plugin allows you to checkout multiple workspaces in a single Jenkins workspace.
This can be useful if you need to fetch sources from two or more repositories in order to build your
application.

To enable this feature, check the **Use multiple workspaces** box in the SCM configuration. You'll
see a new button "Add workspace..." to append a new workspace to the list of additional workspaces.
The configuration settings are identical to the root ones.

![Freestyle, multiple workspaces](img/freestyle-configuration-multiple-workspaces.png)

⚠ Be careful! ⚠ This setup requires you to specify a subdirectory value **for all
workspaces**, and they must be different from one another. If you don't, you might risk having the
plugin download the contents from two or more repositories into the same directory.

### Poll on controller

The Plastic SCM supports polling for repository changes. Polling is normally done on the agent that performed the last
build, but you can choose to run the polling directly on the controller instead. This puts more work on the controller,
but it makes polling work reliably in situations where the agents come and go; for example, when agents are provisioned
on-demand in a Kubernetes cluster.

Polling uses the same authentication settings as the checkout process, so make sure that your controller is properly
configured if you're relying on system settings.

### Pipelines

If you use scripted pipelines or you want to specify the pipeline script directly in the job
configuration, you can take advantage of the cm command inside the groovy script:

**cm command syntax:**

```groovy
cm(
    branch: '<full-branch-name>',
    changeset: '<cset-number>', // optional
    shelveset: '<shelveset-number>', // optional
    label: '<label-name>', // optional
    repository: '<rep-name>',
    server: '<server-address>:<server-port>',
    cleanup: '<cleanup-strategy>',
    credentialsId: '<credentials-id>',
    workingMode: '<working-mode>',
    directory: '<subdirectory-name>' // optional
)
```

As you see, there's a one-to-one parameter mapping. To use multiple workspaces you simply need to
add multiple `cm` statements, paying attention to the value of the `directory` parameter.

You only need to specify the `changeset` parameter if you'd like all builds to target that changeset in the specified
branch.

Alternatively, you can specify the `shelveset` or the `label` parameter to target a shelveset or a label, respectively.
In those instances, the `branch` parameter is ignored.

The available values for `cleanup` are `MINIMAL`, `STANDARD`, `FULL` and `DELETE`.

In case you want to specify credentials, the available values for `workingMode` are `NONE` (default), `UP` and `LDAP`.

**cm command examples:**

```groovy
cm(
    branch: '/hotfix',
    repository: 'assets-repo',
    server: 'my.plasticscm.server.com:8087',
    cleanup: 'DELETE',
    directory: 'assets',
    workingMode: 'UP',
    credentialsId: 'my-credentials'
)

cm(
    branch: '/dev',
    changeset: '538',
    repository: 'assets-repo',
    server: 'my.plasticscm.server.com:8087',
    cleanup: 'STANDARD'
)

cm(
    shelveset: '538',
    repository: 'assets-repo',
    server: 'my.other.plasticscm.server.com:8087',
    cleanup: 'STANDARD',
    workingMode: 'LDAP',
    credentialsId: 'my-ldap-credentials'
)

cm(
    label: '1.0.1',
    repository: 'assets-repo',
    server: 'my.plasticscm.server.com:8087',
    cleanup: 'STANDARD',
    workingMode: 'UP',
    credentialsId: 'my-credentials'
)
```

**Important!** Don't forget to use the `ssl://` prefix in the server name if your Plastic
Server utilizes SSL. For instance, `server: 'ssl://my.plasticscm.server.com:8088',`

If you'd rather use declarative pipelines (selecting the **Pipeline script from SCM** option),
you'll have to specify the Plastic SCM configuration just as you'd do for a freestyle project. Then,
two new parameters will appear: **Script path** and **Lightweight checkout**.

![Pipeline script from SCM](img/pipeline-script-from-scm.png)

The script path tells Jenkins where to find the pipeline script file. If you defined subdirectories (regardless of how
many additional repositories you described) there are two possible scenarios:
- If **Lightweight checkout** is selected the file is checked-out from the repository alone and placed in the root path,
  so you just need to specify the relative path to the script file within the repository.
  e.g. "Jenkinsfile" (if Jenkinsfile is in the root of the repository)
- Alternatively, if you don't select **Lightweight checkout** you'll need to include the subdirectory in the Script path
  as the repository is downloaded entirely before looking for the script file.
  e.g. "code/Jenkinsfile" (if "code" specified in Directory field). See an example below:

![Pipeline script, multiple workspaces](img/pipeline-script-multiple-workspaces.png)

Enabling **lightweight checkout** lets Jenkins retrieve the pipeline script file directly, without a
full Plastic SCM update.

## Environment variables

If the checkout operation succeeds, these environment variables will be populated with the
appropriate values for the build:

1. `PLASTICSCM_CHANGESET_ID`: Number of the currently built changeset
2. `PLASTICSCM_CHANGESET_GUID`: GUID of the currently built changeset
3. `PLASTICSCM_BRANCH`: Name of the branch in Plastic SCM
4. `PLASTICSCM_AUTHOR`: Name of the user who created the currently build changeset
5. `PLASTICSCM_REPSPEC`: The configured repository specification for the current build

Additional workspaces will include their position in the list, like this:

1. `PLASTICSCM_1_CHANGESET_GUID`
2. `PLASTICSCM_5_AUTHOR`
3. `PLASTICSCM_9_CHANGESET_ID`
4. etc.

#### Use in pipelines

Please have in mind that running the `cm` command in a pipeline script won't automatically set the
environment variables above! This command, as do all VCS commands, returns a dictionary that
contains the environment values set as expected.

To take advantage of that, you should do something like this:

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any

  environment {
    PLASTICSCM_WORKSPACE_NAME = "${env.JOB_BASE_NAME}_${env.BUILD_NUMBER}"
    PLASTICSCM_TARGET_SERVER = "192.168.1.73:8087"
    PLASTICSCM_TARGET_REPOSITORY = "default"
  }

  stages {
    stage('SCM Checkout') {
      steps {
        script {
          def plasticVars = cm(
            branch: "main",
            changelog: true,
            repository: env.PLASTICSCM_TARGET_REPOSITORY,
            server: env.PLASTICSCM_TARGET_SERVER,
            useUpdate: false
          )

          plasticVars.each {
            key, value -> println("${key} = ${value}")
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In the code above, the `plasticVars` dictionary would only be available in the `script` block
inside the 'SCM Checkout' stage. If you'd like access it across different scripts, steps or stages,
you can define the variable in the global scope:

```groovy
def plasticVars

pipeline {
  agent any

  environment {
    PLASTICSCM_WORKSPACE_NAME = "${env.JOB_BASE_NAME}_${env.BUILD_NUMBER}"
    PLASTICSCM_TARGET_SERVER = "192.168.1.73:8087"
    PLASTICSCM_TARGET_REPOSITORY = "default"
  }

  stages {
    stage('SCM Checkout') {
      steps {
        script {
          plasticVars = cm(
            branch: "main",
            changelog: true,
            repository: env.PLASTICSCM_TARGET_REPOSITORY,
            server: env.PLASTICSCM_TARGET_SERVER,
            useUpdate: false
          )
        }

        script {
          plasticVars.each {
            key, value -> println("${key} = ${value}")
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
